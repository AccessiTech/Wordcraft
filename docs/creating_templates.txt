The templates in Wordcraft are simply PHP scripts.  PHP is a great
templating language.  Why reinvent the wheel?

The templates are scoped so that global space will not interfere.  The
variable that Wordcraft prepares within the template scope is name $WCDATA.
All the data you will need to create your templates should be in this
array.

To display an element of this array, simple use PHP code like:

<?php echo $WCDATA["title"]; ?>

This would display the contents for the HTML title tag.

Some things are nested arrays like the posts for the front page.  To loop
through those items, simply use the PHP foreach:

<?php foreach($WCDATA["posts"] as $post) { ?>

    <?php echo $post["subject"]; ?>

<?php } ?>

Below you will find all of the data available to you in the different files.
Some things are available in all files.  Others are special for certain template
files.
