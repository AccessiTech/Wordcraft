Wordcraft Installation
======================

 Requirements
 ------------

 PHP 5.0.5 or higher is required
    - PHP 5.2.2 or higher is recommended
    - mysqli extension is required
    - tidy extension is optional

 MySQL 5.0 or higher


 Instructions
 ------------

 1. Download the Wordcraft package and unzip it, if you haven't already.

 2. If you do not already have a database, create one for your Wordcraft
    installation.  Please take note of the database name, user name and
    password.

 3. Go to the include direcory and find the file named config.php.default.

 4. Rename the file config.php.

 5. Open the file in your favorite text editor.  We do not recommend using
    Notepad on Windows as it does not recognize all types of text files.
    If you do not already have a favorite, we recommend using Wordpad on
    Windows.  If you are using a Mac, you can use TextEdit.  If you are
    using Linux, I bet you already have a favorite.

 6. In this file, you will find a section of text like below:

    // Database options
    "db_prefix"   => "wc",
    "db_server"   => "",
    "db_name"     => "",
    "db_user"     => "",
    "db_password" => "",

    Fill in your database settings here.  If you don't know these settings,
    you will need to ask your web host for them.  You may leave db_prefix
    as it is unless you are setting up more than copy of Wordcraft in the
    same database.  If you are, you can use whatever you want here as long
    as it is numbers, letters and _.  Do not use spaces in your prefix.

 7. If the Wordcraft code is not already on a server, you should upload it
    now using your FTP client, web hosting control panel, or whatever
    method you prefer for moving files to your server.

 8. Once the code is uploaded, go to your browser and load up the install
    program by going to admin/install.php.

    For example, if your server name is example.com and you installed
    Wordcraft in the main directory of your web site, you should go to the
    URL:

        http://example.com/admin/install.php

    If you installed Wordcraft in some other directory, simply add that
    directory to the URL.

 9. Follow the on screen instructions to finish the installation.

10. Jump for joy!
