Information about the CAPTCHA used in Wordcraft
===============================================

This collection of captcha methods was oringally compiled and assembled
by Maurice Makaay for the Phorum Development Team.  Wordcraft currently
only uses a small portion of the abilities.  However, the full captcha
code base is included here to allow for other to expand its use in Wordcraft.

The various components of this captcha system are works by other authors
and have separate licenses from Wordcraft.  Please see the various files
for more information on each library.  All licenses are compatible with the
Wordcaft license.
